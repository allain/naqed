# Naqed

## What is it?

Naqed is a naked version of GraphQL.

Naqed is an experiment to distill GraphQL down to its core idea (Graph Querying, IMO) and then to build back up what's needed to make it useful again.

## Current Status

It's 1 days old... so it's less than robust, but it does have 100% test coverage if you're into that kind of thing.
