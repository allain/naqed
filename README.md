# Naqed

## What is it?

Naqed is an **experiment** to strip down all of the abstraction around GraphQL. 

* It uses JSON as the interop, rather than the GraphQL language. 
* It has optional types
* It supports defining custom types (and scalars) in a simple way.

##  Installation

``` bash
npm install --save naqed
```

## Examples

Can be found in the examples directory of the repo.
